# Celagius

Build C projects with C.

A header only library with useful tools to build C projects with nothing but a C compiler.

## Usage

```c
// Put something here
```

## Name

The name is a portmanteau of C and Pelagius, who believed that a person could perfect themselves and reach a right
standing with God entirely through their own efforts.
This belief was condemned as heresy at the Synod of Diospolis in 415.
Unlike mankind, who can only become righteous by the Spirit of God and not by any works of their own, this library aids
the user to build a C program with only a C compiler.
